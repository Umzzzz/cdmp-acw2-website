<p>The shot I have taken is a landscape of Trees and Pathway at Whitworth Park. I always walk past this park on my way to gym, in the mornings.  
The reason why I taken a shot of the trees and the pathway in the park is that when I am sitting on the bench, I look in far distance of the pathway and it makes me think about my life, 
what I have achieved so far in life and what I am going on to achieve throughout the rest of my life. So with my impressionism affects applied in Photoshop I want the user to draw into my landscape image and have the same feeling I had or other connections with the photograph I have taken.</p>

<p>I done a cubism effect on one of watches, this watch I wear with my suits to work or when I’m going out on occasion with family and friends. 
The watch is so unique and sleek so I wanted to create a cubist effect out of it. The shot was taken as a portrait shot, focusing on the dial of the watch.
Then I applied the effects through Photoshop.  My inspiration came from Piccaso paintings at his time when the movement started. He has made some amazing cubist collage. 
Finally I tried different pictures of a person and a chair, but the effect was not as good as the watch picture. Overall I feel cubism works well with objects.</p>

<p>This week I have been working on Futurism Art Movement. I have chosen a sporty car to apply this effect, as it works really well. 
The shot of the car is brand new 2014 plate BMW, the shot I taken of the car was landscape shot and I was focusing on front end of the car, as it looked mean and beastly. 
Reason behind the shot is that one day I can see myself in the future driving a prestige car like the one I have taken in my photograph. That’s why I work and study hard, to have a bright future ahead of me with a well-paid salary job.   
My inspiration has come from various futurist paintings from Filippo Marinetti. So I applied a futurist effect through Photoshop by giving the car a digital effect. Finally I think futurism effects only work well with moving objects like a car.</p>

<p>Pop Art has always been a favourite Art Movement of mine. Growing up I have been a big fan of comic books from the Marvel series. 
The art work in the comic’s just look amazing, each time you flick through a comic, your just thinking in your mind WOW! Also Andy Warhol’s Pop Art pieces have inspired me as his pieces are just amazing, you can see the feeling and emotion he put in his POP Art pieces. 
That’s why he is one of the recognisable artists in history.</p>

<p>So I taught I’ll do my own version of Pop Art in a comic form using Photoshop. This picture was taken when I went out with a few close friends to Leeds.  We ate in a well-known restaurant called Mumtaaz. The shot was taken in a portrait. 
I am sitting down in this amazing chesterfield leather seats, I’m a very big fan of chesterfield leather, and I think they look amazing pieces of furniture. 
Hopefully when I have my own property one day I can see me owning a piece of chesterfield Leather furniture. Finally whenever I look back at this picture, it reminds me of the good time I had in Leeds.</p>

<p>Surrealism art movement is an unusual piece of art. At the time, there was a lot of killing going on during the post war. 
Therefore, the surrealist artist wanted a way to show their emotion through their piece of work and give the humanity some sort of hope for the future of living. 
Surrealist iconic artist like Salvador Dali, wanted to set people free from the misery from what happen in the war.  So he showed his emotion through is art by applying modernism, which gave people hope of the future.  </p>

<p>Therefore, I thought I give a go with my version of surrealism. I chose to do a piece of art on myself. Where I am merging two images to make a cool effect in Photoshop in this Digital era. The art piece consist of me in a suit a self-portrait and overlay layer image of the amazing building of Emporio Armani in Manchester. 
The reason behind this piece of art was I wanted to show that I in a suit and big building show some sort of my future career in the industry, working in some sort of office. 
I could see myself working in a nice architecture building like the Emporio Armani.  In addition, it shows that I dream of expensive lifestyle in future, wearing top designer clothing like Emporio Armani.</p>
