<h1>Pop Art</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2> 

<p>Pop Art movement started as early as in the 1950s. Pop was used in Popular Culture such as advertising, news and comic books, which were features of mass culture as well. Honnef (2004), states, “I used the term, and also “Pop Culture”, to refer to the products of the mass media, not works of art that draw upon popular culture.”  (Honnef:2004:6)</p>

<p>The term first came across in British art critic, Lawrence Alloway’s article in 1958. As Dempsy (2002), states, “The term Pop first appeared in print in an article by the English critic Lawrence Alloway (1926-90) in 1958...” (Dempsy:2002:217)</p>
 
<p>In addition to this rock and roll, drugs and sex was becoming popular and Pop Art inherited part of the cultures as key artists express their emotions through their sculpture and paintings with different elements of this type of culture.</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>

<p>Pop art began in the 1950s in Great Britain but established itself even further in United States. The movement was a success in America as stated by McCarthy (2000), “The rapid acceptance of Pop as codified movement with an entire phalanx of artist’s admirers and promotors was without precedent in the history of American Art.” (McCarthy:2000:195)</p>

<p>On the other hand, when pop came along there were on going debates of what was even classed as art. Pop art developed in a time when advertising was being used in many forms, as Livingstone (1990) states, “Advertising has caused a revolution in the popular art field.”(Livingstone:1990:36)</p>

<p>The creativeness for pop art came from everyday objects that were extensively open to the public. Key ides for many artists like Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns came from products like Brillo boxes and Coca-Cola. Pop Art movements was becoming the leading culture, and their art left a stamp in the cultural world as the artists were producing some of their finest work but this made the public question what art actually is.</p>

<h2>Social context of the movement</h2>

<p>In regards to the social context the post war generation had developed and began to work and earn quite a lot of money and became financially stable. The war left shattered and traumatised imagery in people’s lives and the people felt strongly about living in a different kind of world.  In particular, Britain, rationing lasted until 1950s and the war destroyed buildings in many towns and cities. Livingstone (1990) states, “Pop has come to be regarded as an art of external appearances, a resolutely post-War form of realism dedicated to the dispassionate deification of the common object and to the manipulation of images and sign systems extracted ready-made from the mass media.” (Livingstone:1990:15)</p>

<p>On the other hand, many at that time wanted colour, modernity and clean lines in their lives seen in American comic books, but most importantly they wanted new products to spend their money on such as the latest technology in vacuum cleaners, televisions and faster cars. As McCarthy(2000) states, “However, over the course of a full decade, Pop was one of the central movements in British and American art, establishing several individuals artist of the first rank, affecting directly the course of later art through the world, and reconfiguring our understanding of twentieth-century culture.” (McCarthy:2000:14)</p>

<h2>Key Influences</h2> 

<p>Pop Art has had an influence from abstract impressionism and it grew rapidly from then onwards to becoming a key movement in art history. The rise of consumerism economy played a big part of forming the Pop Art movement in the 1950s and 1960s. Pop gave uproar against the old fashion way of art styles and started to look at popular figures, balanced images and applied different colours to an image. This became the main theme for artist Andy Warhol. </p>

<p>As Livingstone (1990) states, “Given that Pop as a whole represented an opening out of possibilities and rebellion against rigid set of artistic conventions, it was inevitable that its true force as a movement, and the main reason for its continued influence on subsequent generations of artists, has resided not in its codification but in a series of ideas and strategies open to constant redefinition.”(Livingstone:1990:90)</p>

<p>Furthermore, music had a great impact in developing the pop art movement; as musical sensation bands like the Beatles helped transform the industry. McCarthy (2000) states, “He would further participate in the Pop culture of the following decade by designing album covers for bands such as the Beatles.” (McCarthy:2000:11)</p>

<h2>Key Players</h2> 

<p><strong>Andy Warhol</strong> originally from Pittsburgh was born on 6th August 1928. He was a well-known icon and nicknamed the ‘God Father', who elaborated in the pop art movement. Warhol studied pictorial design at Carnegie Institute of Technology and after his studies he moved to New York City in 1949. At this stage, Warhol was quite traditional in the way he dressed and spoke. He pursued a career in commercial art for magazines as his current and original style of art was very attractive and pertinent to the post war era.</p>

<p>Warhol initial art centred on reproducing newspapers, advertising, and American pop culture symbols like Coca Cola, sex symbols like Marilyn Monroe and Campbell’s soup cans. Year 1962 was Warhol’s first vital presentation of pop art at the Realist Exhibition in New York.</p>

<p>In late 1963, Warhol started film making; he had his own studio called The Factory which was well recognised. This space became the upbringing for new actors, artists and musicians. At this time, Warhol had revolved himself to become a trademark. He was no longer following the dress trend at that time, Warhol created an identity for himself who would always wear unusual wigs and sunglasses and just like his art, would rebel social convention.</p>

<p>Andy has made a name for himself as a world famous artist. There was a demand for his art pieces; he had exhibitions around the globe throughout 1970’s and 1980’s. Sadly the great artist died on 22nd February 1987 after a gall bladder operation in New York.</p>

<p><strong>Roy Lichtenstein</strong> was born on October 27th 1923 in New York. He was one of the most important figures in the pop art movement. His art was visualised through his passion in advertisements and comic books.</p>

<p>In 1940 Lichtenstein studied at Art Students League, learning techniques and taking a lot from American Realist Reginald Marsh. The he went on to study at Ohio State University, but his studies got stalled as he was recruited and called for war. “Pop Eye” was one of his first art works in Pop Art in 1961. In 1963, “Whaam!” was one of his most recognisable art works which was adapted from a comic book called DC Comics All-American Men of War. Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol were the top dogs of the pop art movement in the mid 1960’s. Sadly on September 29th 1997, Lichtenstein died of pneumonia at the New York University Medical Centre.</p>

<p><strong>Richard Hamilton</strong>, he was known as the ‘daddy’ to the pop art scene.  Hamilton was born in London on February 24th 1922; his first creation was popular art image. During 1938 to 1940, Hamilton done his studying at the Royal Academy School, he was earning a living through the advertisement industry; this would clarify why Hamilton was capable to see how consumerism could be used to portray modern living and also become art.</p>

<p>Hamilton continued his studies at Slade School of Art and the University College of London. He drove away from convention and created his art using objects he found. Hamilton used bits of magazines, typewriters, paints, newspapers and bits of material to produce his art work. The first pop art piece to obtain iconic status was Hamilton’s very own. “Just what is it that makes today's homes so different?” This piece of art was made from cut outs of comic strips, glamour models and body builders. This art piece done by Hamilton was making a statement of modern art and it was the first to use advertising. In this particular piece of art, on the stairs there was an advertisement for a hoover and there was a tin of ham on the table.  This initiated a period in which consumerism would become the focus of artists fragments of high quality art.</p>

<p>Hamilton laid some guidelines in what pop art should be, by sending a letter to Peter and Alison Smithson in 1957. They were the following,   big business, glamorous, sexy, witty, gimmicky, young (aimed at youth), low cost, mass produced, gimmicky, popular (designed for a mass audience), expendable (easily forgotten) and transient (short term solution).</p>

<p>The above guidelines set by Hamilton became the essentials of pop art. Also the guidelines appear to be the strategies for advertising campaigns. Hamilton was able to see the relationship between art and advertising. Sadly Hamilton died at the age of 89 on 13th September 2011.</p>

<h2>Its relevance today</h2> 

<p>It has been over 60 years since the art movement of pop art began; it still has an importance in today’s living. This varies from film and media, advertising, clothing and t-shirts printing of famous faces of films stars, artists and brands which are available to purchase around the globe. Famous music artists like Lady Gaga who are out there to challenge what suitable is and lay a way to new forms of modern art, by her outrageous outfits.  Movies like The Avengers is an award winning film that take key impacts from comic and graphic novels.</p>

<p>Pop art was a movement that tested the traditional of art and help change the mind-set of the world in the post war era. The movement added hope, colour and modernity in the globe that were set to war. Pop Art allowed people to move on from horror of war by introducing new fashions, technology and an improved modern way of life, which still impacts us today.</p>
