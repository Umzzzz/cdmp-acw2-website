# Art Movement Project 

This project is showing  my creative skills using Adobe Photoshop. Part of my ACW 2 project for Creative Digital Media Production, 
I am required to produce five pieces of Art Movement, with a little rationale to go with my finish pieces of art movements. 
These art movements include Impressionism. Cubism, Surrealism, Futurism and Pop Art. Also I have chosen to do an essay on my 
chosen art movement which is Pop Art.The website will feature two posters that I have designed in regards to my chosen 
Art Movement.
